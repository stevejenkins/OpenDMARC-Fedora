OpenDMARC-Fedora
===============
This git repo contains:

- **SPECS/opendkim.spec** - systemd-compatible spec file for the OpenDMARC package I co-maintain in Fedora & EPEL (https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/opendmarc/)

- **PATCHES** - patches for the spec file, as needed, depending on version

**CONTRIBUTORS:** Please do pull requests in the "develop" branch only. The "master" branch is just for release versions. Thanks!
